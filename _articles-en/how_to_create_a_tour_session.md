  - "Fixed start time" - with setting start time;
  - "Customer can choose a time" - the user can select the start of the tour from the range set by this option.

  - "Start time is flexible" - the start of the tour is not indicated (the tour can start at any time). In the booking modal, instead of indicating the time, there will be an inscription "N / A";
- "Seats Availability" - the number of seats on the tour. Four options are available ("Unlimited"; "Limited - fixed limit per session" with the choice of the number of seats; "Limited - By resources");
