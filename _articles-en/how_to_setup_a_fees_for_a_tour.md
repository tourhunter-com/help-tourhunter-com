## **Step 3**

 Fill the required fields:
 
"Name" - fee name;

"The listed price includes this fee" - checkbox, if turned on, the amount isn’t displayed in booking in “Total > Fees & Taxes”, because the fee amount is already included in the tour amount;

“Rate Type” - dropdown with 2 values:

     “Per booking” - fee amount for the booking;

     “Per person” - fee amount for the selected participants. Click “Select participants” for the necessary selection of participants;

“Amount” - fee amount (“$” or “%”);

“Apply to” - dropdown with 2 values:

     "Everyone" - for every customer;

     "Custom countries" - for selected countries. Click “Countries > Add country”.
