When you click on the link, the employee’s profile opens with the first tab “Public info” displayed. When you go to the tab “Job Instructions”, a card with a job instruction is displayed. By clicking on the card, a block with the job instruction text appears below.

### **Update Job Instruction**

After each save of changes in the “Job Instruction”, an employee will receive a notification in the “Pending Actions”.

By clicking on the link, an employee will go to his profile, where on the tab “Job Instructions” he can get acquainted with job instructions. 

A notification will be displayed for the employee until he agrees with the job instruction by clicking on the “Agree” button in the "Job Instructions" tab.
